# image_resizer

these project currently contains two unit tests (using NUnit).

you need to setup the nightly repo for image resizer first (https://www.myget.org/F/imazen-nightlies/api/v2).

when running the tests there will be created two files, one good and one bad one (having alpha-blending working and not working).

the tests will also emit the execution time which could be a lot faster probably when jpeg encoding / decoding on windows would not be that lame ?!
